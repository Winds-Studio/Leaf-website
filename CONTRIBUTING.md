## ‚úçÔ∏è Documentation Writing Standards

To keep documentation consistent across all languages and sections:

- Use **English (half-width) punctuation in all languages**.
- Add **a space after commas or periods**.
- For parenthesis, use spaces outside unless followed by punctuation:
    - Yes: `Ôºà foo Ôºâ`
    - No: `ÔºàfooÔºâ`
- For logic phrases like `If true` or `If < 0`, translate as:
    - `Â¶ÇÊûúËÆæ‰∏∫ \`true\``
    - `Â¶ÇÊûúËÆæ‰∏∫ < \`0\``
- Separate English words in Chinese text with spaces.
    - Example: `‰ΩøÁî® Java ÈªòËÆ§ÁöÑÈÄªËæë`
- When referring to a single config/setting/option, use:
    - `ÈÖçÁΩÆÈ°π`
- Use headings, lists, and semantic Markdown structure for clarity.
- Add alt text to images and keep links descriptive.

## üìê Code Style & Commit Guidelines

- Use **descriptive commit messages**:
    - Good: `Fix typos in Gale config documentation`
    - Bad: `Update docs`
- Reference issues or todos where relevant (e.g., `Fix #12`).
- Test your changes locally (`pnpm dev`).
- Keep pull requests focused‚Äîone topic per PR is best.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style for code changes (optional, but preferred):
    - Example: `feat(config): add example for leaf flags`
- Run `pnpm build` to verify static build success, if relevant.
- For code: Prefer clean, readable, and well-commented JavaScript/TypeScript.

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Sync** your fork with the upstream repository regularly.
2. **Create a feature branch** for your changes.
3. **Push and open a Pull Request:**
    - Include a clear, descriptive summary of what you changed and why.
    - Reference related issues or todos if applicable.
4. **Address code review feedback** promptly.
5. **Keep PRs focused and minimal**; split larger changes into multiple PRs when possible.
